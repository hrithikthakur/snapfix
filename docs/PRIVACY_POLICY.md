# Privacy Policy for SnapFix

**Effective Date:** November 22, 2025

## 1. Introduction
SnapFix ("we", "our", or "us") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use the SnapFix desktop application ("App").

## 2. Data Collection and Usage

### 2.1 Text Processing
SnapFix function is to correct grammar and spelling in the text you select.
*   **How it works:** When you trigger the SnapFix shortcut (e.g., Option+Space), the App captures the currently selected text.
*   **Third-Party Processing:** This text is sent securely to **Google's Gemini API** for processing.
*   **No Storage:** We do not store, log, or save your text on our servers. The text is processed in transit and returned immediately to your device.
*   **Gemini API:** By using SnapFix, you acknowledge that your text is processed by Google. Please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for details on how they handle API data.

### 2.2 API Keys
*   If you provide your own API key, it is stored locally on your device in a secure manner. We do not have access to your personal API key.

### 2.3 Usage Data
*   We do not track your individual usage behavior or the content of your corrections.
*   The App may collect anonymous, aggregate technical data (e.g., crash reports or version numbers) to help us improve stability.

## 3. Permissions

### 3.1 Accessibility Permissions (macOS)
SnapFix requires Accessibility permissions on macOS to function.
*   **Purpose:** This permission is strictly used to:
    1.  Detect the selected text.
    2.  Replace the selected text with the corrected version.
*   **Limitations:** We do not use this permission to monitor your keystrokes, log your activity, or access data outside the context of the specific text correction action you initiate.

## 4. Data Security
We prioritize the security of your data. Communication between the App and the Gemini API is encrypted using standard HTTPS protocols. Your API key (if applicable) is stored locally on your machine.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the updated version distributed with the App or posted on our website.
