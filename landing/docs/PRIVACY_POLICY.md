# flickfix Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 28 December 2025  
**Last updated:** 28 December 2025

## 1) Who we are (Data Controller)

flickfix ("flickfix", "we", "us") is the data controller for the personal data described in this policy.

**Contact:** [flickfix100@gmail.com](mailto:flickfix100@gmail.com)  
(If you later form a company, add the legal entity name and registered address here.)

This policy is written to meet the UK GDPR transparency expectations for privacy information.

---

## 2) What this policy covers

This policy covers:

* The **flickfix desktop application** (the "App")
* This **flickfix website and documentation pages** (the "Site")

If you click links to third-party websites (such as Google), their policies apply to their services.

---

## 3) What flickfix does (plain English version)

flickfix helps you correct grammar, spelling, and clarity in text you select. When you trigger flickfix (for example, with a keyboard shortcut), the App reads the text you selected, sends it to the **Google Gemini API** for processing, and then inserts the corrected result back where you were typing.

flickfix is designed to work only when you intentionally trigger it, not in the background.

---

## 4) Personal data we process

### 4.1 Selected text (when you trigger flickfix)

**What:** The text you have highlighted or selected at the moment you trigger flickfix.  
**Why:** To generate a correction and return it to you.

**Important:** flickfix does **not** store your selected text on flickfix servers. However, your selected text is sent to Google's Gemini API, and Google may retain prompts, context, and outputs for abuse monitoring for **55 days**, and may use authorised human review for flagged content, as described in Gemini API policies.

### 4.2 API keys (if you bring your own Gemini API key)

**What:** Your Gemini API key (if you choose to use one).  
**Where:** Stored locally on your device in the operating system's secure storage (for example, macOS Keychain).  
**Access:** We do not receive or store your API key on flickfix servers.

### 4.3 Diagnostics and support data (minimal)

We aim to collect **no behavioural analytics by default**. If you contact us for support, or if you choose to send diagnostics, we may process:

* your email address (if you email us)
* app version, OS version, and device details needed to debug
* crash or error logs (which typically include technical details like stack traces)

We do not intend to collect the content you selected for correction as part of diagnostics. If you send us screenshots or logs manually, please avoid including sensitive personal data.

---

## 5) Lawful basis for processing (UK GDPR)

We process personal data under the following lawful bases:

* **Contract:** processing selected text is necessary to provide the core flickfix functionality you request.
* **Legitimate interests:** limited diagnostics and security measures (for example, preventing abuse, improving stability) where this is proportionate and does not override your rights.

Where a different lawful basis is required in the future (for example, consent for optional analytics), we will ask you clearly and update this policy.

---

## 6) Third parties we share data with

### 6.1 Google Gemini API

When you trigger flickfix, your selected text is sent to Google's Gemini API for processing.

Google's Gemini API policies describe retention for abuse monitoring (including prompts, context, and outputs retained for 55 days) and potential authorised human review of flagged content.

Gemini API terms also include important restrictions (including age requirements and regional requirements).

---

## 7) International data transfers

Because text is processed by Google, your data may be processed in countries outside the UK. Google's Gemini API documentation and terms describe how the service operates, including abuse monitoring practices and retention.

---

## 8) Data retention

* **Selected text:** flickfix does not store your selected text on flickfix servers. Google may retain prompts, context, and outputs for abuse monitoring for 55 days (per Gemini API policy).
* **Support emails:** kept as long as needed to respond and maintain a record of the support interaction, then deleted or minimised where practical.
* **Diagnostics (if provided):** kept only as long as needed to investigate and fix issues, then deleted or anonymised where practical.

---

## 9) Security

We use reasonable technical measures to protect data handled by flickfix:

* network communication to the Gemini API is encrypted using HTTPS
* API keys are stored locally using secure OS storage mechanisms
* we aim to minimise data collection

No system is perfectly secure, but we design flickfix to keep the amount of data we handle as low as possible.

---

## 10) Permissions (macOS Accessibility)

On macOS, flickfix may request **Accessibility permissions** so it can:

* read the currently selected text when you trigger flickfix
* insert the corrected text back into the active application

We do not use Accessibility permissions to monitor keystrokes in the background, log activity, or continuously read what you type. The permission is used for the user-initiated correction flow.

---

## 11) Age restrictions

flickfix is intended for users aged **18 and over**. Gemini API terms require users to be 18+ and prohibit API clients directed to or likely accessed by under 18s.

---

## 12) Automated decision-making

flickfix uses an AI model (via Gemini API) to generate text corrections. flickfix does not perform automated decision-making that produces legal effects or similarly significant effects about you. You remain in control of what text you select and whether you apply the result.

---

## 13) Website cookies and tracking

We do **not** use cookies, analytics scripts, or tracking technologies on the flickfix website. The website is static and does not collect personal data through cookies or similar technologies.

---

## 14) Your data protection rights (UK)

Depending on your circumstances, you may have rights including access, correction, deletion, restriction, and objection.

To exercise your rights, contact us at: **[flickfix100@gmail.com](mailto:flickfix100@gmail.com)**.

You also have the right to complain to the UK supervisory authority, the **Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)**. ICO guidance highlights that people should be told they can complain to the ICO and given clear privacy information.

---

## 15) Changes to this policy

We may update this policy to reflect product changes, legal requirements, or improvements in how we explain things. We will update the "Last updated" date at the top, and publish the new version on our website.
