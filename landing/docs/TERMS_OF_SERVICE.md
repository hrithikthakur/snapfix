# SnapFix Terms of Service

**Effective date:** 22 November 2025  
**Last updated:** 28 December 2025

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of SnapFix (the "App") and the SnapFix website and documentation (the "Site"). By downloading, installing, or using SnapFix, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use SnapFix.

## 1) Who we are

SnapFix is provided by **SnapFix** ("we", "us", "our").

**Contact email:** [flickfix100@gmail.com](mailto:flickfix100@gmail.com)  
**Geographic address:** [Add your business address or service address here]

UK rules for online service providers commonly expect clear provider details, including a geographic address.

## 2) Eligibility

You must be **18 years or older** to use SnapFix.

SnapFix uses Google's Gemini API. Gemini API terms require users be 18+ and restrict offering API clients directed to or likely accessed by under-18s.

## 3) The service

SnapFix helps you correct spelling, grammar, and clarity in text you select. When you trigger SnapFix (for example, by a shortcut), the App sends the selected text to a third-party AI provider (such as Google Gemini API) and returns the result to your device.

## 4) Licence and permitted use

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to use SnapFix for personal or internal business use, subject to these Terms.

You agree to use SnapFix lawfully and responsibly.

## 5) Prohibited use

You agree not to:

* use SnapFix to process or generate unlawful content, infringing content, or content that violates others' rights
* use SnapFix in a way that interferes with, disrupts, or harms the App, the Site, or others
* attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, bypass security, or misuse the App (except where permitted by law)

## 6) Your responsibilities (including API keys)

If SnapFix requires you to provide your own API key (for example, a Gemini API key):

* you are responsible for keeping your API key secure
* you are responsible for all usage, limits, and charges associated with your key
* you must comply with the third-party provider's terms and policies

## 7) Third-party services (Google Gemini API)

SnapFix relies on third-party services (including the Gemini API). Your use of those services is subject to their terms and policies.

Google's Gemini API policies explain that prompts, context, and outputs may be retained for **55 days** for abuse monitoring.

We are not responsible for third-party services, including outages, changes, or how those providers process data.

## 8) Privacy

Our Privacy Policy explains how SnapFix handles data. By using SnapFix, you acknowledge that selected text may be processed by third-party AI services (such as Gemini API) when you trigger SnapFix.

## 9) Feedback

If you provide suggestions, bug reports, or feedback, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual licence to use that feedback to improve SnapFix, without compensation to you.

## 10) Intellectual property

SnapFix and all related branding, designs, and code are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of SnapFix except as expressly permitted by these Terms.

## 11) Disclaimers

SnapFix is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis.

* **AI output disclaimer:** SnapFix uses AI to suggest corrections. Suggestions may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate. You are responsible for reviewing text before using it.
* We do not guarantee the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or available at all times.

## 12) Limitation of liability

Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability where it would be unlawful to do so.

In particular, we do not exclude or limit liability for **death or personal injury caused by negligence**, or for fraud. UK consumer law commonly treats these as non-excludable.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for:

* indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive losses
* loss of profits, revenue, goodwill, opportunity, or anticipated savings
* loss of data (except to the extent caused by our breach of applicable law)

If you are a business user, our total liability to you for claims relating to SnapFix will not exceed the amount you paid to us for SnapFix in the 12 months before the event giving rise to the claim (or £50 if you paid nothing), unless a higher amount is required by law.

**Digital content note (UK):** digital content can interact unpredictably with devices and other software. Where UK consumer rules apply, you may have remedies if digital content causes damage, and any limitation must be fair.

## 13) Suspension and termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to SnapFix if:

* you breach these Terms
* we reasonably believe your use creates risk or legal exposure

You may stop using SnapFix at any time. Sections that by their nature should survive will survive termination (including IP, disclaimers, and limitations of liability).

## 14) Changes to SnapFix and these Terms

We may update SnapFix or these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we will update the "Last updated" date and publish the updated Terms on our Site. Continuing to use SnapFix after changes take effect means you accept the updated Terms.

## 15) Governing law and jurisdiction

These Terms are governed by the laws of **England and Wales**. Courts of England and Wales will have jurisdiction, except where mandatory consumer protection rules require otherwise.
