# flickfix Terms of Service

**Effective date:** 22 November 2025  
**Last updated:** 28 December 2025

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of flickfix (the "App") and the flickfix website and documentation (the "Site"). By downloading, installing, or using flickfix, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use flickfix.

## 1) Who we are

flickfix is provided by **flickfix** ("we", "us", "our").

**Contact email:** [flickfix100@gmail.com](mailto:flickfix100@gmail.com)  
**Geographic address:** [Add your business address or service address here]

UK rules for online service providers commonly expect clear provider details, including a geographic address.

## 2) Eligibility

You must be **18 years or older** to use flickfix.

flickfix uses Google's Gemini API. Gemini API terms require users be 18+ and restrict offering API clients directed to or likely accessed by under-18s.

## 3) The service

flickfix helps you correct spelling, grammar, and clarity in text you select. When you trigger flickfix (for example, by a shortcut), the App sends the selected text to a third-party AI provider (such as Google Gemini API) and returns the result to your device.

## 4) Licence and permitted use

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to use flickfix for personal or internal business use, subject to these Terms.

You agree to use flickfix lawfully and responsibly.

## 5) Prohibited use

You agree not to:

* use flickfix to process or generate unlawful content, infringing content, or content that violates others' rights
* use flickfix in a way that interferes with, disrupts, or harms the App, the Site, or others
* attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, bypass security, or misuse the App (except where permitted by law)

## 6) Your responsibilities (including API keys)

If flickfix requires you to provide your own API key (for example, a Gemini API key):

* you are responsible for keeping your API key secure
* you are responsible for all usage, limits, and charges associated with your key
* you must comply with the third-party provider's terms and policies

## 7) Third-party services (Google Gemini API)

flickfix relies on third-party services (including the Gemini API). Your use of those services is subject to their terms and policies.

Google's Gemini API policies explain that prompts, context, and outputs may be retained for **55 days** for abuse monitoring.

We are not responsible for third-party services, including outages, changes, or how those providers process data.

## 8) Privacy

Our Privacy Policy explains how flickfix handles data. By using flickfix, you acknowledge that selected text may be processed by third-party AI services (such as Gemini API) when you trigger flickfix.

## 9) Feedback

If you provide suggestions, bug reports, or feedback, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual licence to use that feedback to improve flickfix, without compensation to you.

## 10) Intellectual property

flickfix and all related branding, designs, and code are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of flickfix except as expressly permitted by these Terms.

## 11) Disclaimers

flickfix is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis.

* **AI output disclaimer:** flickfix uses AI to suggest corrections. Suggestions may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate. You are responsible for reviewing text before using it.
* We do not guarantee the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or available at all times.

## 12) Limitation of liability

Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability where it would be unlawful to do so.

In particular, we do not exclude or limit liability for **death or personal injury caused by negligence**, or for fraud. UK consumer law commonly treats these as non-excludable.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for:

* indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive losses
* loss of profits, revenue, goodwill, opportunity, or anticipated savings
* loss of data (except to the extent caused by our breach of applicable law)

If you are a business user, our total liability to you for claims relating to flickfix will not exceed the amount you paid to us for flickfix in the 12 months before the event giving rise to the claim (or £50 if you paid nothing), unless a higher amount is required by law.

**Digital content note (UK):** digital content can interact unpredictably with devices and other software. Where UK consumer rules apply, you may have remedies if digital content causes damage, and any limitation must be fair.

## 13) Suspension and termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to flickfix if:

* you breach these Terms
* we reasonably believe your use creates risk or legal exposure

You may stop using flickfix at any time. Sections that by their nature should survive will survive termination (including IP, disclaimers, and limitations of liability).

## 14) Changes to flickfix and these Terms

We may update flickfix or these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we will update the "Last updated" date and publish the updated Terms on our Site. Continuing to use flickfix after changes take effect means you accept the updated Terms.

## 15) Governing law and jurisdiction

These Terms are governed by the laws of **England and Wales**. Courts of England and Wales will have jurisdiction, except where mandatory consumer protection rules require otherwise.
